1. 4x speedup from single core ISPC SIMD. 28x speedup from multicore.
2. Changed the random input to 2.99f for all elements. Perfectly balanced workload across vector lanes and cores. 
5x speedup from single core ISPC SIMD. 32x speedup from multicore.
3. Make elements 1.0f for most of the array except some elements being 2.99f with a stride of 8. This should decrease 
the vector unit utilization to about 1/8. 0.84x speedup from single core ISPC SIMD.
