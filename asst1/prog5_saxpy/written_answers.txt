1. About 1.7x speedup from use of tasks. This algorithm is heavily memory-bound and cannot be substantially improved.
2. Write-back caches in modern CPUs means that the result will be first written to the cache, during this process, the cache line 
will be loaded from DRAM, causing an extra memory load.
