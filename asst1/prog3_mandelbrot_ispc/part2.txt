1. Tasked ispc achieves 9-10x speedup compared to serial and about 2x compared to non-tasked ispc. 
2. I used 200 tasks. The number has to evenly divide height which is 800. The more tasks there are, 
the more finely chopped up the total workload is, and the more even the workload distribution is. 
But if there are too much, the overhead (might be caused by synchronization or communication) outweights the benefit. 
3. ispc tasks are abstracted, 10000 ispc tasks can be put in a work queue and be dynamically assigned to 8 threads 
which is the maximum number of execution contexts the cpu can handle. Threads however, is physical implementation 
and 10000 of threads for 10000 ispc tasks can cause a lot of context switch.
