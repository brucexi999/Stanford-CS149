View 1 gives about 5x speedup compared to the serial implementation. View 2 gives about 4x.
Ideally we would expect an 8x speedup. The actual number is smaller because different pixel regions need different amount of compute. 
There's workload imbalance between different lanes inside the vector units in one core. For view 2, there are more 
white-black edges, causing more uneven workload between lanes.
